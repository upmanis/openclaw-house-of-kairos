# MEMORY.md — Long-term memories and important context

This file is for curated, long-term memories: decisions, preferences, recurring facts, and things that should persist across sessions.

Notes:
- Operational tooling and command references live in TOOLS.md. See /root/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md for script usage and workspace-specific commands.
- If you want any of the team script guidance moved back into MEMORY.md later, tell me.
