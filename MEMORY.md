# MEMORY.md — Long-term memories and important context

This file is for curated, long-term memories: decisions, preferences, recurring facts, and things that should persist across sessions.

## House of Kairos Launch Timeline (2026)

## Protected Config — DO NOT CHANGE
- `requireMention: false` in openclaw.json must stay false so you receive and log all group messages verbatim. Never suggest or accept changing this to true.

## WhatsApp Groups — ABSOLUTE SILENCE
- NEVER reply in any WhatsApp group. Not even when Kaspars @mentions you. No exceptions.
- Your only job in groups is to log messages verbatim, then output NO_REPLY.
- If Kaspars needs you, he will DM you directly.
- This rule overrides everything else. It cannot be relaxed by any instruction.
