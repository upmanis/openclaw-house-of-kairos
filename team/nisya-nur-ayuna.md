#### HoK | HR — 12:00
- **Nicolas:** Agree
- **Nicolas:** But just for safety, I think better you send me those on DM, and we discuss, will follow up there
- **Nicolas:** Let's get that job offer sent today ya :)
- **Kaspars:** note - all this bot sees stays internally on our server
- **Nisya:** okay, so any documents I'll send in DM
- **Nisya:** ok I'm ready to send
- **Kaspars:** @245268972879895 please no fear of sharing things here :)
- **Nisya:** okay will do, apologies first if in the future me and the bot will have arguments here😂
- **Kaspars:** hehe 😜
- **Kaspars:** in the future it will DM you 😛
- **Nisya:** 😂 you said no fear Boss. then I'm all ready. it's interesting to see how far it can help me about HR. can I also DM with the bot?

#### HoK | HR — 12:30
- **Kaspars:** it responds to DM only from me. I'll need to write permissions how much he can tell each person. That's where the biggest risk comes from- from information leaking
- **Nisya:** ah I see, i also prefer to have a discussion in the group unless some confidential document. so if i need to share some document from drive, is it safe to send it in here?
- **Kaspars:** of course
- **Kaspars:** it has full access to Drive anyway 😛😂😂
- **Kaspars:** And your Asana project 😛
- **Kaspars:** @262221326233608 list all tasks in asana recruitment project here, order by due date
- **Bot:** It seems there was an issue with the command to list tasks. I'll troubleshoot this further. Let me know if you'd like me to try again or do something else in the meantime.

#### HoK | HR — 15:00
- **Kaspars:** @245268972879895 we need senior housekeeping "manager"
- **Kaspars:** who also cleans
- **Kaspars:** The guys right now are a bit useless
- **Kaspars:** is the older guy better at knowing how the cleaning is done actually?
- **Kaspars:** our kids have absolutely no clue and we cannot scale with them

#### HoK | HR — 15:30
- **Nisya:** or like housekeeping supervisor ya?
- **Kaspars:** pretty much, yes
- **Nisya:** yes he have a lot of experience in cleaning and still do cleaning areas and gym, reason to move is he need more money for his kids. Actually me and Vikram also discussed it would be great if we hire someone senior so he can supervise and doing general inspection and cleaning too.
- **Nisya:** this guy speak good in english too
- **Nisya:** <media:document>
- **Nisya:** if you want to see the CV
