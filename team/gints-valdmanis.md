## Professional Background

- **Personal Fitness Trainer** — self-described as "Fitness and Wellbeing Expert, Elite Personal Trainer, Nutrition and Supplement Specialist"
- **Previous employers:** Global Fitness, Sporta klubs Centrs (both in Latvia)
- **Competitive bodybuilder** and fitness model — Latvian-born, active in the IFBB scene
- **Social media influencer** — significant following in Latvia's fitness community; part of a well-known Latvian "fitness couple" with Jekaterina
- **Traveled ~55 countries** before settling in Bali

## Personal Philosophy

Values simplicity and peace over material wealth. Described Bali as a lifelong dream destination. Quoted saying life "offers no practice version" — appreciates living fully. Critical of Latvia's current direction, calling it "at a very low point" with a fractured, negative society. Said he doesn't recognize his homeland anymore and has no immediate plans to return.

## Bali Connection

Relocated to Bali with his family, initially for winter season, now living there more permanently. Based in Seseh near Canggu. Experienced the severe flooding firsthand — his wife got trapped at a gym during monsoon rains. Noted Bali's infrastructure challenges with drainage and sanitation. Despite the conditions, continues daily routines and taking his daughter to activities.

## At House of Kairos

- **Role:** Fitness Manager (since Sep 2025, contract through Aug 2026)
- **Digital footprint:** Minimal — one WhatsApp exchange logged, zero Asana tasks
- **Profile:** Brings serious credibility — competitive bodybuilder, 62K Instagram following, years of elite personal training experience. The kind of hire that anchors a gym's reputation. His low activity in project management tools likely reflects a floor-first, people-first management style rather than disengagement. With the gym still under construction, his scope will expand significantly as the fitness operation goes live.
