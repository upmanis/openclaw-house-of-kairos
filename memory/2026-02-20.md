- **Kaspars:** /visual-explainer - build a summary of how the project is structured
- **Bot:** Here’s a lightweight visual explainer of how the Construction Checklist project is structured, in a way you can quickly read or paste into a diagram tool.  1) Quick overview - Workspace: House of Kairos   - Projects include: Construction Checklist, General Timeline, Recruitment, F&B, PA tasks, Architecture, CRM & Mobile App, etc. - Target project: CONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST (GID 1208771583102101) - Within the project:   - Sections (or groups) like GF, LGF, ROOFTOP, GYM, etc. These act as the main buckets for tasks.   - Tasks: each task has a name, assignee, start date (start_on), due date (due_on), and may have extra fields (notes, followers, custom_fields).   - Custom fields: e.g., Project (House of Kairos / Villa Rock / Personal) to classify tasks.   - Assignees: Kaspars Upmanis, Vikrama Imanthaka, Nisya Ayuna, etc.   - Status: typical states like Overdue, Upcoming, Completed.  2) ASCII diagram (high level) Workspace: House of Kairos (GID 1208695572000101)   └── Projects       ├── CONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST (1208771583102101)       │   ├── Sections (e.g., GF, LGF, ROOFTOP, GYM, etc.)       │   │   ├── Tasks       │   │   │   ├── [Task name] — [Assignee] — [Due_on / Start_on]       │   │   │   └── ...       │   │   └── ...       │   ├── Custom Fields       │   │   └── Project: House of Kairos / Villa Rock / Personal       │   └── Followers/Assignees: Kaspars, Vikrama, Nisya, etc.       ├── General Timeline       ├── F&B       ├── Recruitment       ├── PA tasks       └── Architecture   Notes:   - Example tasks (from project now):      - GF: Library - Modulo k.id shelving units for Library — Kaspars — due date varies     - ROOFTOP: Floor Waterproofing — Kaspars     - GYM: Storage room painting — Kaspars   - Dates and status vary per task (Overdue, No date, etc.)  3) Mermaid-style (optional for quick diagram rendering) If you want to render this visually with Mermaid, you can use this starter:  graph TD   A[Workspace: House of Kairos] --> B[Projects]   B --> C[CONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST (1208771583102101)]   C --> D[Sections: GF, LGF, ROOFTOP, GYM, ...]   D --> E[Tasks: GF: Library - ...]   E --> F[Assignee: Kaspars / Vikrama / Nisya / ...]   E --> G[Dates: start_on / due_on]   C --> H[Custom Fields: Project (House of Kairos / Villa Rock / Personal)]   C --> I[People: Kaspars, Vikrama, Nisya, Vikrama, ...]   click E "/path-to-task-details" "Open task details"  If you’d like, I can: - Produce a more detailed ASCII tree with actual sections and sample tasks from this project. - Generate a ready-to-paste Mermaid diagram using the exact sections and tasks you care about. - Produce a compact one-page summary (roles, dates, and ownership) suitable for a tabletop briefing.  Would you prefer the ASCII version fleshed out with the real sections and a few representative tasks, or would you like the Mermaid diagram tailored to a specific view (e.g., by section or by assignee)?
- **Kaspars:** generate as html and give me link
- **Bot:** I can deliver an HTML version, but I need to know how you want the link provided:  Options - Data URL (self-contained HTML in a link you can open in a browser) - HTML file saved in the workspace with a shareable path (e.g., a file link or you can download from here)  Which do you prefer? If you pick, I’ll generate and return the exact link. If you want, I can also tailor the HTML content (more detail, Mermaid diagram, etc.).
- **Kaspars:** Data URL
- **Bot:** Here is your HTML data URL (self-contained):   data:text/html;base64,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  Would you like me to tailor the content further or provide a Mermeid diagram inside the HTML as well?
- **Kaspars:** ok, give me html file
- **Bot:** HTML file created.  - Location: /root/.openclaw/workspace/construction_checklist_overview.html  Would you like me to provide a data URL for this HTML file as well, or tailor the HTML content further (e.g., add a full task table, mermaid diagram, or embedded styles)?
- **Kaspars:** nothing to do.
- **Bot:** Got it. If you need anything later—like a today’s group-chat summary, revenue checks, or another HTML/data URL/file—just say the word and I’ll run it. I’m standing by.

### Memory/Tools/Agents hygiene — 2026-02-20
- Reviewed `MEMORY.md` for items that belong in `TOOLS.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
- No tool/environment/behavioral rules were moved (they already live in `TOOLS.md`/`AGENTS.md`).
- Removed a small meta “notes” block from the top of `MEMORY.md` that was redundant with `AGENTS.md`/`TOOLS.md` references.
