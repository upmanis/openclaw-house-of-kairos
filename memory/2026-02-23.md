### WhatsApp — DM — Kaspars — 08:30
- **Kaspars:** why no daily summary this morning?
- **Bot:** [[reply_to_current]] Because the **“daily-summary” cron isn’t scheduled for the morning**.  Right now you have: - **daily-summary:** runs **15:00 WITA** (so it writes the daily file in the afternoon, not morning). It last ran **~18h ago** and is scheduled to run again later today. - A separate job **“Daily 7am WITA …”** runs at **07:00 WITA** (that one is *not* the same as the daily-summary).  Also: the daily summary is primarily **written into `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`**; it won’t necessarily “message you” unless we explicitly make it send a WhatsApp DM.  If you want, tell me what you prefer and I’ll align it: 1) **Send you a WhatsApp DM daily summary at 07:00 WITA**, or   2) Keep writing to the memory file only, or   3) Both.
